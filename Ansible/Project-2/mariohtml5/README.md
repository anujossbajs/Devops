This is a clone of Infinite Mario, written in JavaScript for web browsers using HTML5.
A good demonstration of what can be accomplished with the Canvas and Audio elements.
Background music currently does not work in any browser besides Firefox 4. I think. There were too many problems with other browsers.
Ported from the Java version by Notch (Markus Persson).

--- Demo for Ansible Playbook created by Prasanjit Singh ---
